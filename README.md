Implementation of Semi-supervised Active Learning Algorithms in Medical Image Classification

The aim of this project is to optimize labelling costs of medical images in deep learning models using advanced algorithms that utilize the intrinsic properties of the available data to improve the performance of the model. This will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach leveraging semi-supervised learning, active learning, and their integration, thus addressing the time-intensive nature of accurate labeling and the need for vast amounts of labeled data. Specifically, we will utilize semi-supervised learning to leverage the structure of unlabeled data, augmenting labeled datasets. Additionally, we will employ active learning techniques to select the most informative instances for annotation, optimizing labeling resources. Finally, we will develop a framework for semi-supervised active learning, combining both methodologies to achieve superior performance while minimizing labeling costs. We also aim to compare the performance of these algorithms with the traditional supervised learning paradigm to demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.
